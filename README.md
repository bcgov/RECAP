### `recap-subnet-nsg/` - Networking Foundation
**Creates the network infrastructure that everything else depends on:**
- Virtual network subnets with optimized IP allocation
- Network Security Groups with BC Gov compliant security rules
- Private endpoints for secure Azure service connectivity
- SPANBC network access (142.22.0.0/16)

### `recap-llm/` - Azure OpenAI Service
**Handles Azure OpenAI service deployment only:**
- Creates Cognitive Services account with BC Gov policy compliance
- Configures public access disabled and network ACLs
- Supports model deployments (GPT-4o, gpt-4o-mini)

**Model Cost Comparison (2025 Pricing):**
- **GPT-4o**: $2.50 input / $10.00 output per million tokens (Standard SKU)
- **GPT-4o-mini**: $0.15 input / $0.60 output per million tokens (GlobalStandard SKU)
- **Cost savings**: gpt-4o-mini is ~94% cheaper than gpt-4o (16x cheaper per token)

**SKU Requirements:**
- GPT-4o uses Standard SKU (regional data residency)
- GPT-4o-mini requires GlobalStandard SKU in Canada East for better load balancing and availability

### `recap-web-proxy/` - Application Layer
**Manages the proxy application and web app deployment:**
- Nginx proxy with connection pooling, SSL termination, and BCgov security controls
  - IP whitelisting for BC government networks
  - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Health monitoring endpoint (`/healthz`) for Azure App Service
- Docker container build and Azure Container Registry operations
- Azure Web App with VNet integration
- End-to-end testing and validation

## Quick Start Deployment

**Complete deployment sequence:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Create networking foundation
.\recap-subnet-nsg\networking-config.ps1 -Environment "prod"
.\recap-subnet-nsg\private-endpoint-deploy.ps1 -Environment "prod"

# Step 2: Deploy OpenAI service
.\recap-llm\openai-deploy.ps1 -Environment "prod"

# Step 3: Build and deploy web application
.\recap-web-proxy\nginx-generate-config.ps1 -Environment "prod"
.\recap-web-proxy\acr-container-push.ps1 -Environment "prod"
.\recap-web-proxy\webapp-deploy.ps1 -Environment "prod"

# Step 4: Test deployment
.\recap-web-proxy\proxy-llm-basic-test.ps1 -Environment "prod" -Model "both"
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- Docker Desktop running (for container operations)
- PowerShell execution policy allows script execution
- Contributor access to target Azure subscription

## Troubleshooting

### OpenAI Service Name Already Exists
If you encounter an error that the OpenAI service name is already in use due to a previous deletion, you need to purge the soft-deleted service first:

```powershell
# Check for soft-deleted OpenAI services
az cognitiveservices account list-deleted --query "[?contains(name, 'd837ad') && contains(name, 'econ-llm-east')]"

# Purge the soft-deleted service to free up the name
az cognitiveservices account purge --name "d837ad-{Environment}-econ-llm-east" --resource-group "d837ad-{Environment}-networking" --location "canadaeast"

# Example for prod environment:
az cognitiveservices account purge --name "d837ad-prod-econ-llm-east" --resource-group "d837ad-prod-networking" --location "canadaeast"
```

This immediately frees up the service name for reuse instead of waiting 30+ days for automatic purging.
